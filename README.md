# PythonWordGames
Two word games (Conundrum and Hangman) created using Pyton and TkInter.

Words can be added by using the Edit Words button at the main menu.
Encryption has been used to prevent players from simply opening the txt file containing the words.

Two games are playable and an overall score for the session is recorded (1 point for a win, -1 point for a loss).
Conundrum: Guess the word from an anagram, constricted by a 30 second timer.
Hangman: Guess letters of a word in under 6 attempts.
